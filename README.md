## YG Prima is not an art brand built for visibility — it is built for permanence.
Each creation is a one-of-one modern artwork, never replicated, never reissued, and never placed into public circulation. Crafted on the finest Italian linen and grounded in hand-finished red sandalwood, every canvas is designed to endure not trends, but time itself.

YG Prima does not operate on volume. Only a highly limited number of works are created each year, each privately offered to a select circle of collectors who understand that true value does not announce itself. Prices begin at $2 Million+, reflecting not just the materials or craftsmanship, but the philosophy behind ownership — rarity, restraint, and legacy.

There are no catalogs. No open listings. No public sales.
Every artwork is personally delivered, accompanied by formal documentation, and positioned as an asset meant to outlive its era.

Value is quiet. Legacy is quieter.
YG Prima exists where noise ends.
